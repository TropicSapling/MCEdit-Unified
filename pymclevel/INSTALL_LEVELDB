DEPENDENCIES

BINARIES
~~~~~~~~

These binaries/tools have to be installed on system in order to compile
leveldb_mcpe:

* g++
* make
* unzip
* wget


LIBRARIES
~~~~~~~~~

You will need to have zlib v1.2.8 or 1.2.10 installed on your system.
Other versions can work, but no garantee..

If zlib is not found on your system, the script will build the version 1.2.10
specifically for PE support. See ZLIB section for more details.


~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just run 'python setup_leveldb.py' et voil√†!


~~~~
ZLIB
~~~~

The leveldb library need zlib to work.

The ideal version is 1.2.10, but PE support also works with 1.2.8.

If zlib is not found, the script will build it and 'install' it in the
'pymclevel' directory. This zlib library will be used only for PE support, and
will no be available for other applications on your system.

If zlib is found on your system, but with another version than 1.2.8 or 1.2.10
and leveldb compilation fails or does not work at runtime, it is possible to
force zlib compilation using the '--force-zlib' switch for the script.
